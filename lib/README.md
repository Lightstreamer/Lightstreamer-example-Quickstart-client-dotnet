This folder should contain the <b>Lighstreamer SDK for .NET PCL Clients</b>, to be used for the build process.<br>
Get the  binaries files of the library (`Lightstreamer_DotNet_PCL_Client.dll` and `Lightstreamer_DotNet_PCL_Client.pdb`) from NuGet [Lightstreamer.DotNet.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lightstreamer.DotNet.Client/) or use directly the Package Manager Console `Install-Package Lightstreamer.DotNet.Client`.
Then copy them into this folder of the project.
